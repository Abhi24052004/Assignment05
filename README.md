Task 1: Create a Dictionary of Student Marks

Problem Statement: Write a Python program that:
1.   Creates a dictionary where student names are keys and their marks are values.
2.   Asks the user to input a student's name.
3.   Retrieves and displays the corresponding marks.
4.   If the studentâ€™s name is not found, display an appropriate message.


Task 2: Demonstrate List Slicing 

This Python program demonstrates:
1. Creating a list of numbers from **1 to 10**.
2. Extracting the first **five elements** from the list.
3. Reversing the extracted elements (sorting them in descending order).

It helps understand the use of:
- for loops
- append() method
- sort() with reverse=True
- List manipulation in Python.
