Task 1: Create a Dictionary of Student Marks

This Python program allows the user to input a student's name and retrieves their marks from a predefined dictionary.  
If the student does not exist in the dictionary, the program displays **"Student not found."**

It demonstrates the use of:
- Dictionaries (dict)
- User input (input())
- Dictionary methods (.get())



Task 2: Demonstrate List Slicing 

This Python program demonstrates:
1. Creating a list of numbers from **1 to 10**.
2. Extracting the first **five elements** from the list.
3. Reversing the extracted elements (sorting them in descending order).

It helps understand the use of:
- for loops
- append() method
- sort() with reverse=True
- List manipulation in Python.
